### Prerequisites

*   A modern web browser.

2.  Push all the project files (`index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`, `assets/bell.mp3`) to the repository.
3.  Go to your repository settings on GitHub.
4.  Navigate to the "Pages" section.
5.  Under "Build and deployment," select "Deploy from a branch" and choose your main branch (e.g., `main` or `master`) and the `/ (root)` folder.
6.  Save your changes. Your application should be deployed to GitHub Pages within a few minutes, accessible via the URL provided in the Pages section.

## Future Enhancements
